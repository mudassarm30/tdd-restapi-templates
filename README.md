# Test Driven RestAPI Project Templates

Welcome to the Test Driven RestAPI Project Templates repository! This collection includes Rest API projects implemented in various technologies, each following best practices and utilizing a test-driven approach. Feel free to explore the projects to understand my technical capabilities.

## Django Python with MongoDB Integration

### Overview
This project is a Rest API built using Django in Python, seamlessly integrated with MongoDB. It adheres to a test-driven development (TDD) methodology, ensuring robustness and reliability. The code-first approach has been employed, emphasizing clean and maintainable code.

### Features
- Django framework for web development
- MongoDB integration for flexible and scalable data storage
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment to AWS Lambda Function and API Gateway
- Unit test suite for comprehensive code coverage

### Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the project up and running locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up your MongoDB instance.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the development server with `python manage.py runserver`.

## C# (Entity Framework)

### Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of a Rest API using C# with Entity Framework. It incorporates industry best practices and is developed with a test-driven approach to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Features
- C# language for robust application development
- Entity Framework for data access and management
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Unit test suite to validate the functionality

### Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the connection string in the `appsettings.json` file.
3. Build and run the project using your preferred IDE or the command line.

## Java (Spring Boot with Hibernate)

### Overview
This project showcases a Rest API implemented in Java using the Spring Boot framework and Hibernate as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool. The project follows best practices and embraces a test-driven development approach.

### Features
- Java programming language for platform independence
- Spring Boot for simplified configuration and development
- Hibernate ORM for database interaction
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Unit tests ensuring the reliability of the codebase

### Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the database connection in the `application.properties` file.
3. Build and run the project using your preferred Java IDE or the command line.

## PHP (Laravel)

### Overview
This project exemplifies a Rest API developed in PHP using the Laravel framework. It follows best practices, including a test-driven development approach, to ensure a robust and maintainable codebase.

### Features
- PHP programming language for server-side scripting
- Laravel framework for elegant and expressive syntax
- GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment
- Test-driven development for code reliability

### Getting Started
To run the project locally:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Configure the database connection in the `.env` file.
3. Install dependencies using `composer install`.
4. Run the development server with `php artisan serve`.
5. To remove a branch locally and remotely

```bash
git branch -D <branch-name>
git push origin --delete <branch-name>

```
